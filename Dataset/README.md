DESCRIPTION:
---
Here application examples of computeC:

The files here contain:
1. gene_expression.txt: A text file presents expression levels of genes across patients whose rows are patients and columns are genes.

2. clinical_features.txt: A text file presents clinical features of patients whose rows are patients and columns are genes. NOTE that the patients here are also in *gene_expression.txt* with exactly the same order.

3. computeC_processed_data.R: R code examples to process the raw data from scratch before inputting them to computeC.

4. computeC_processed_data.RData:  Processed data are available to run computeC immediately.
